        <h3>WEB BROWSER</h3>
        <p>
          You do not know what web browsers are? A web browser is a software
          program that allows you to access the internet and all the web pages
          in it. Most common web browsers are Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge,
          Brave, Firefox, and Safari, and you are most definitely reading this
          article in one of these.
        </p>

        <p>
          The objective of this Python project is to create a GUI based Web
          Browser. To build this, you must have intermediate understanding of
          the PyQt5 library, and its modules, including the WebEngineWidgets
          module that you will need to install separately.
        </p>

        <p>
          Project Prerequisites: To build this Python Web Browser project, we
          will need the following libraries: 1. PyQt5 – To create the GUI. 2.
          sys.argv – To get the inputs entered from the command line 3.
          PyQt5.QtCore.QUrl – The QUrl class will be used to convert string
          objects to a Qt acceptable URL object that will navigate through all
          the websites. 4. PyQt5.QtWidgets – To get the Widgets, including but
          not limited to: a. QAction – This widget allots an abstract user
          interface action to widgets in the form of text. b. QLineEdit – Single
          line input box [Tkinter alternative: Entry widget] c. QToolbar – This
          widget is used to add a frame-like container to the top of the window.
          5. PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets.QWebEngineView – It is used to load the
          content of a website directly from the internet.
